This chapter describes the entire process of setting up and using a database. If you are interested only in accessing an existing database, 
you may want to skip the sections that describe how to create the database and the tables it contains. Because this chapter is tutorial in nature, 
many details are necessarily omitted. Consult the relevant sections of the manual for more inbunchation on the topics covered here.
